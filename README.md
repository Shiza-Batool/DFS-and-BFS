# DFS-and-BFS-
This code defines a directed graph as an adjacency list, where the keys of the outer dictionary represent the vertices of the graph, and the values are dictionaries that map adjacent vertices to their corresponding edge weights. The graph represents the road network of some cities in Romania.
The code then defines two graph traversal algorithms, Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS), that take as input the graph, a start vertex, and a goal vertex, and return the shortest path from the start vertex to the goal vertex, along with its distance.
The BFS algorithm maintains a queue of paths to explore, where each path is a list of vertices that leads from the start vertex to the current vertex, along with the distance covered so far. The algorithm explores the neighbours of the current vertex in a breadth-first fashion, adding them to the queue if they have not been visited yet. The algorithm terminates when the goal vertex is found, in which case it returns the shortest path and its distance, or when all paths have been explored, in which case it returns None.
The DFS algorithm maintains a stack of paths to explore, where each path is a list of vertices that leads from the start vertex to the current vertex, along with the distance covered so far. The algorithm explores the neighbours of the current vertex in a depth-first fashion, adding them to the stack if they have not been visited yet. The algorithm terminates when the goal vertex is found, in which case it returns the shortest path and its distance, or when all paths have been explored, in which case it returns None.
Finally, the code tests the algorithms by finding the shortest path from the source vertex 'Arad' to the goal vertex 'Bucharest', using both BFS and DFS, and printing the results.
